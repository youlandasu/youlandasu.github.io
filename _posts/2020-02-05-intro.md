I'm a PhD student from School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology. I'm advised by Prof. Biing-Hwang (Fred) Juang. My research interest is in Natural Language Processing, Dialogue System Automation, and Spontaneous Speech Recognition. Before attending Georgia Tech, I got my B.S. of Communications Engineering and honor graduation from Harbin Institute of Technology, China.

I'm currently focused on semantic representations in spoken language understanding (SLU), and dialogue state tracking (DST) for dialogue service automation, deep learning methods for sequential labeling tasks. I've also been with Interactions LLC for NLP Research Internship, working on text generation for improving natural language understanding in food service domain. I also did research internship on factural correction for knowledge-driven dialogues via masking and rewriting at Tencent AI Lab, working with Dr. Kun Xu and Dr. Linfeng Song.

My thesis research aims to affiliate goal-oriented dialogue system to automate human-machine dialogues. Topics cover spoken language understanding for semantic parsing, dialog modeling for managing dialog states, etc.
